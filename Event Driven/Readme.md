# Event Driven

**EventBridge** is a serverless service that uses events to connect application components together, making it easier for you to build scalable event-driven applications. Use it to route events from sources such as home-grown applications, AWS services, and third- party software to consumer applications across your organization. EventBridge provides a simple and consistent way to ingest, filter, transform, and deliver events so you can build new applications quickly.
